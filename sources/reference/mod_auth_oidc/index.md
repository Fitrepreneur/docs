This is an authentication and/or authorization module for the Apache 2.x
HTTP server implementing OpenID Connect.

## What is OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect is defined as "a simple identity layer on top of the
OAuth 2.0 Protocol" according to [OpenID Connect
Website](http://openid.net/connect/). It allows clients, including
