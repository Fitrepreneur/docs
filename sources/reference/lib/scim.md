# Simple Cloud Identity Management

Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) is a standard **REST/JSON API to standardize User and Group CRUD** (Create, read, update, delete). The purpose of SCIM is to reduce cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. 

Detailed specifications for SCIM can be found at [http://www.simplecloud.info](http://www.simplecloud.info).
