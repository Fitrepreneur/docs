# Authentication in the Gluu Server

The Gluu Server was designed to be very flexible in handling unique requirements for authentication. By default, the Gluu Server utilizes LDAP (either the local LDAP included in all Gluu Server deployments or an existing backend LDAP via our Cache Refresh process) for basic username/password authentication. However, the Gluu Server's authentication cabilities can be extended through the use of custom jython interception scripts to call any third party authentication mechanism's APIs. For example, the Gluu Server ships with a script that calls the APIs for the free two-factor authentication mobile application, Super Gluu.
