# Manual Cluster
## Design
The following diagram outlines the design of the cluster.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7156097/13850591/9a553fde-ec28-11e5-8fa7-675f96743a10.png)
## Requirements

For complete deployment requirements and instructions, please see the [Deployment Page](../deployment/index.md).
The requirements for Clusters vary only in the RAM requirement. Clusters require at least 8GB RAM for smooth performance. The requirements below are specific for Cluster Installation VMs.


|	Number of VMs	|CPU Units	|	RAM	|Root Partion	|	Port Requirements	|
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
|	2		|	2 CPU ea.	|	8 GB	|	40 GB	|	4444 and 8989		|

**Note:** For convenience, the VMs are identified as `host-1` and `host-2`

## Preparing VMs

* Install Gluu CE following the [Deployment Page](../deployment/index.md) in `host-1`

* Change the IP address in the `setup.properties.last` from `host-1` and install Gluu CE in `host-2`

## LDAP Replication

* Things to know

|	host-1			|	host-2		   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
|IP Address eg. 192.168.6.1	|Ip Address eg. 192.168.6.2|
|	LDAP admin pass		|	LDAP admin pass	   |
|ldapGeneralConfigInstall.py	|
|replicationSetup.py		|

* Run [ldapGeneralConfigInstall.py](./ldapGeneralConfigInstall.py) in `host-1`. This script will prepare the `host-1` LDAP server to accept various configurations such as `allow-pre-encoded-passwords` or applyting the host and port for LDAP Server.

* Run [replicationSetup.py](./replicationSetup.py) in `host-1` and it will give a similar output as below:

```
[ldap@]$ python replicationSetup.py 
Create a password for the replication admin: 
Enter number of OpenDJ servers: 2
Enter the hostname of server 1: 192.168.6.1
Enter the Directory Manager password for 192.168.6.1: xxxxx
Enter the hostname of server 2: 192.168.6.2
Enter the Directory Manager password for 192.168.6.2: yyyyy

Initializing schema on server 192.168.6.2:4444 with the contents of server 192.168.6.1:4444 ..... Done.

Replication has been successfully enabled.  Note that for replication to work you must initialize the contents of the base DNs that are being replicated (use dsreplication initialize to do so).

operation.

* Initialize directory server replication with this command `/opt/opendj/bin/dsreplication initialize` and it will give the following output:

```

## File System Replication

`csync2` is used for file system syncing between `host-1` and `host-2`. The following locations are synced in between the two VMs.

1. /opt/idp/conf
2. /opt/idp/metadata
3. /opt/idp/ssl
4. /opt/tomcat/conf
5. /etc/csync2/csync2.cfg

### csync Configuration for host-1

1. Log into Gluu-Server container

2. Install epel-release-latest by running `rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm`

3. Install `csync2` package by running `yum install csync2`

4. Generate `csync2` private key by running `csync2 -k csync2.key` and put it into `/etc/csync2/csync2.key` file

5. Copy the private key to `host-2` and put it into the same file there

6. Generate certificate/key pair that will be used to establish SSL protection layer for incoming connections by running next commands on <code>host-1</code> (location of the files and their names are hardcoded into executable). Don't fill any fields, just hit `Enter` accepting default values

```
openssl genrsa -out /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem 1024
openssl req -new -key /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem -out /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 600 -in /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.csr -signkey /etc/csync 2_ssl_key.pem \ -out /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.pem
```

### csync Configuration for host-2

1. Log into Gluu-Server container

2. Install epel-release-latest by running `rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm`

3. Install `csync2` package by running `yum install csync2`

4. (If you haven't done it yet) Copy the private key you generated on `host-1` previously to `host-2` and put it into `/etc/csync2/csync2.key` file 

5. Generate certificate/key pair that will be used to establish SSL protection layer for incoming connections by running next commands on `host-2` (location of the files and their names are hardcoded into executable). Don't fill any fields, just hit "Enter" accepting default values:

## Certificate Management

The certificates do not vary in the manual cluster configuration. The certificates should be updated manually 
in each host, when required. Move to `/etc/certs/` on the 1st node (inside the container). Copy all keys, certs and key storages conforming to these masks: `httpd.*`, `asimba.*`, `asimbaIDP.*` and `shibIDP.*` to the same directory on the 2nd node (overwriting files that exist there; you may opt to backup them first, just in case). Please note that in case of CE cluster you **must not** sync OpenDJ's certificates (`/etc/certs/opendj.crt`) between nodes, they must stay unique for each of them!

After that's done you still will need to update default system storage (`cacerts` file) at the 2nd node with these newly copied certificates. The [Certificate Page](../gluu-defaults/certificates.md) contains the details about available certificates and how to change them.
